# **Thunderbird and Whale Bookstore System- Project Portfolio 3 - Python.**

The Thunderbird and Whale bookstore system is based on the notorious bookstore that Bella Swan is seen to visit in Twilight. It's situated in the town of Forks which has a very simplistic and calm nature surrounding the town- similarly, the app system I created also does not have an overload of information, The app is simply useful as it allows the owners of the bookstore to effectively and quickly recieve data on how many books the need to order into the shop at the beginning of the new week by calculating how many books were sold, ordered and the difference between these figures.

The live site is available for viewing here - <a href="https://***" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thunder and Whale Bookstore System.</a>

# Objective

For my third project I wanted to create something simple, useful and something that still related to one of my passions. As a huge Twilight fan and bookworm that would love to own a book shop this simple but effective system is perfect. I believe this system of calculating future orders needed is also something that can be used by all business, just differin g in scale, therefore it is simple but highly effective.

# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype

I used Figma to design a very basic wireframe as I knew this command line application would be simple in its appearance. The system still ended up being slightly different with a dark brown background being used as opposed to a dark green and a button instead of a title above the terminal. However, I still preserved the simplistic and cozy theme of the site.
