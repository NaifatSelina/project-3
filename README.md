# **Thunderbird and Whale Bookstore System- Project Portfolio 3 - Python.**

The Thunderbird and Whale bookstore system is based on the notorious bookstore that Bella Swan is seen to visit in Twilight. It's situated in the town of Forks which has a very simplistic and calm nature surrounding the town- similarly, the app system I created also does not have an overload of information, The app is simply useful as it allows the owners of the bookstore to effectively and quickly recieve data on how many books the need to order into the shop at the beginning of the new week by calculating how many books were sold, ordered and the difference between these figures.
